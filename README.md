:question: **What is this Repository About?**
This tutorial covers everything from reviewing test projects and cases to demonstrating the application of implementing Data-Driven Patterns. Discover the significance of a data-driven approach and how it can revolutionize your testing strategy. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the importance of leveraging data in your tests for more effective outcomes.

**What Will You Learn?**
- **Understanding Data-Driven Testing:** Get acquainted with the basics of Data-Driven Testing and its importance in enhancing test automation strategies.
- **Implementing Data-Driven Patterns:** Step-by-step guidance on how to implement Data-Driven Patterns in your test projects, showcasing practical applications and benefits.
- **Leveraging Data for Effective Testing Outcomes:** Learn how to effectively use data to increase test coverage, flexibility, and efficiency.

**:key: What is the Data-Driven Testing Design Pattern?**
Data-Driven Testing allows tests to execute with different data sets, enabling the validation of various input combinations and scenarios. This approach separates test data from test scripts, usually storing this data in external sources like spreadsheets or databases. Test scripts are designed to read this data and perform actions based on it, significantly increasing the test suite's coverage and flexibility.

### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
